# BIT_C_Learning
This is a set of demos for C language learning on lexue.bit.edu.cn.
All files are .cpp files and should be compiled with Bloodshed DEV-C++.
[Warning] If you want to hand in your homework with my program, copy the paragraphs you want rather than just upload the original file!!!
[Tips] Github Copilot is really useful, try to debug with it.
